,AXR3,AT1G04250,"Transcription regulator acting as repressor of auxin-inducible gene expression. Auxin-inducible AUX/IAA gene. Short-lived nuclear protein with four conserved domains. Domain III has homology to beta alpha alpha dimerization and DNA binding domains. Involved in auxin signaling and is a positive modulator of natural leaf senescence. Auxin induces the degradation of the protein in a dosage-dependent manner in a process mediated by AtRac1. Auxin induced the relocalization of the protein within the nucleus from a diffused nucleoplasmic pattern to a discrete particulated pattern named nuclear protein bodies or NPB in a process also mediated by Rac1. Colocalizes with SCF, CSN and 26S proteasome components."

,ER,AT2G26330,"Homologous to receptor protein kinases. Involved in specification of organs originating from the shoot apical meristem. Contains a cytoplasmic protein kinase catalytic domain, a transmembrane region, and an extracellular leucine-rich repeat. ER has been identified as a quantitative trait locus for transpiration efficiency by influencing epidermal and mesophyll development, stomatal density and porosity of leaves. It has been implicated in resistance to the bacterium Ralstonia solanacearum and to the necrotrophic fungus Plectosphaerella cucumerina. Together with ERL1 and ERL2, ER governs the initial decision of protodermal cells to either divide proliferatively to produce pavement cells or divide asymmetrically to generate stomatal complexes. ER binds to the peptides STOMAGEN and EPF2 which compete for the same binding site. The ER-EFP2 complex activates MAPK signaling that inhibits stomatal development. ER-STOMAGEN does not activate MAPK signaling. Plants harboring loss of function alleles of er are more susceptible to heat stress than wild type. In Arabidopsis and other organisms, overexpression of ER confers thermotolerance via as yet undefined mechanisms."

Homologous to the Antirrhinum PHANTASTICA (PHAN) and maize ROUGH SHEATH2 (RS2) genes Asymmetric placement of auxin response at the distal leaf tip precedes visible asymmetric leaf growth. Acts alongside AXR1 to exclude BP expression in leaves and with PIN1 to repress BP and promote lateral organ growth. Interacts physically with AS2 to form a complex that binds to the BP promoter and silences BP. Also functions as a regulator of the plant immune response.
